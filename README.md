# google_search_webpage
This project is part of Harvard's CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course.

As a way of practicing web development, I was able to recreate Google's homepage to be able to use as a regular search engine using HTML and CSS. Since this webpage is supposed to resemeble Google's Search Engine, the project uses several of Google's own aesthetics to look and act like Google. From the main page, the user is able to search anything using a GET request from Google's own search queiries. In addition to this, I have also created webpages that resemble Google Images, and Google Advanced Search, so the user is able to navigate to these pages is desired.

Feel free to use the live demo and navigate through the pages.
